## TODO

Some things to do in no particular order:

* Get a list of file that were drag/dropped on the tool
* Take the files and upload them to Evernote as notes
* Log in to evernote profile
* Create a note name based on the file name

## IDEAS

* Instead of integrating direct with the web services, use the Evernote.exe application or the ENScript.exe application for windows.
